# Improvements for real-word production ready application

This project was built to meet the core requirements while intentionally minimizing external dependencies. In a real-world production application, leveraging well-established libraries and tools would significantly improve development speed, maintainability, and user experience.

## State Management

Replace React Context + useReducer with a lightweight state management library like Zustand or Redux Toolkit for better performance, debugging experience, and developer experience.

## Styling

Consider migrating to Tailwind CSS for faster development, consistent design system, and reduced CSS bundle size.

## Testing

Add comprehensive testing: unit tests (Vitest + React Testing Library) and E2E tests (Playwright)

## Data Validation

Implement Zod for type-safe schema validation, form validation, and API response validation.

## Cart Synchronization

**Current Issue:** Cart only exists client-side. Fake Store API doesn't persist data.

Server-side cart persistence, real-time sync across devices, customer cart migration after login, optimistic updates with rollback.

## Authentication & Checkout

Complete authentication system (OAuth), proper checkout flow with delivery forms, payment gateway integration, and order confirmations.

## ISR Implementation

Add Incremental Static Regeneration for product/category pages with webhook-based revalidation when inventory or content changes.

## Products Filtering

Implement filtering (price, category, rating etc.), sorting, pagination/virtualization, prefetching on hover, and URL state sync.

## Full-Text Search

Add product search with autocomplete, suggestions, and result highlighting.

## Product Details Page

Individual product pages with image galleries, specifications, related products etc.

## User Features

Order history and tracking, cart sync across devices, wishlist functionality, and product reviews/ratings.

## Internationalization

Multi-language support, currency conversion.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Automated testing, code quality checks, type checking, and deployments using GitHub Actions, Vercel, or similar.

## Analytics & Monitoring

User behavior tracking (Google Analytics/Piwik PRO), error monitoring (Sentry)

## UX/UI Improvements

Skeleton loaders, optimistic updates, toast notifications, accessibility, dark mode, and mobile-first enhancements.

## Developer experience & speed

Design system implementation, Storybook for component documentation, API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger), automated dependency updates (Dependabot), and workspace configurations.
